# Catalogue-of-Life-Filter
This repository contains two python scripts that handle the tabular data from the Catlaogue of Life. The first script, "filter.py", removes columns and rows that can be adapted to your preferences. There are also several text files that contain all the column names as well as all the values that are in the column "col:rank", to help sort out unwanted taxonomic ranks (wich there are lots of). The scipt also contains a set of filters that can be activated or deactivted via adding or removing "#". These filter lists are also contained in one of the text files.
The second script, "branchselector.py", can use the output of the first script or the original dataset and select downward from a specific item. So if you want to only have the animals not the rest just input the respictive value from the column "col:id". The script contains a basic list of the main branches of the tree of life (like animalia, bacteria, ...).
The data can then be visualized in programs like cytoscape that have evry powerful visualization tools. One drawback is that the individual branches are not of the same lenght. Addressing this via another script has not had any promising results for me but perhaps you will succeed.
